                    <p>
                        Death literacy is the practical knowledge and skills that help people

                        Avoiding conversations about death often leads to confusion, stress, and
                        missed opportunities for support. Increasing death literacy can:

                        <li>Encourage open, informed conversations</li>
                        <li>Reduce fear and uncertainty</li>
                        <li>Support better end-of-life planning and care</li>
                        <li>Strengthen support for loved ones during loss</li>
