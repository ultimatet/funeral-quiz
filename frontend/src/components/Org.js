                    <p>
                        High levels of death literacy in organizations foster a supportive culture
                        where staff, clients, and community members can engage with death-related
                        topics confidently and respectfully. It enhances decision-making, improves
                        end-of-life care outcomes, and promotes emotional wellbeing by reducing
                        confusion, distress, and isolation during critical moments.
